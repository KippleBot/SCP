    <h1>Object Classes</h1>
    <div>This page will talk about different types of SCP, to help you understand their threat levels.<br><br>
        
      <section class="red"> Apollyon is the highest threat level and can't be contained by any circumstances. These
        anomalies are associated with armagedon or a K-Class Scenario and which it requires a large
        amount from the foundation to deal with them.</section> <br>
       <section class="orange">Thaumiel are anomalies that the Foundation specially uses to contain other SCPs. They are one of the highest levels of the Foundation and their locations.</section>
        <br>
        <section class="yellow">Keter SCPs are anomalies that are exceedingly hard to contain consistently or reliably, with containment procedures often being extensive and complex. The Foundation often can't contain these SCPs well due to not having a solid understanding of the anomaly, or lacking the technology to properly contain or counter it.</section>
        <br>
        <section class="cyan">Euclid-class SCPs are anomalies that require more resources to contain completely or where containment isn't always reliable. Usually this is because the SCP is insufficiently understood or inherently unpredictable.</section>
        
        <br><section class="blue">Safe-class SCPs are anomalies that are easily and safely contained. This is often due to the fact that the Foundation has researched the SCP well enough that containment does not require significant resources or that the anomalies require a specific and conscious activation or trigger.</section>
         
        <br>
        Neutralized SCPs are former anomalies that are no longer anomalous, either through having been intentionally or accidentally destroyed or disabled.
